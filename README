How to use:
  Start the application and click on the "Play" button.
  Free-falling objects will appear on the screen. Tap them to make them bounce and keep them from falling through the bottom of the screen!
  The objective is to keep as many as you can, for as long as you can, on the screen.

                                        
Features:           
  Physics (created from scratch):
  - Gravity
  - Vertical and horizontal acceleration caps (to make game more playable)
  - Collision detection 
  - Rotational bouncing (by touch and collision)
  - Wall constraints (ball bounces off left and right sides of screen)

Future features:
  - Level selection
  - Settings
  - Sound (on/off)
  - Customizable physics
  - Game over screen
  - Save high score and display current score during game
  - Different objects with different attributes than balls
  - Power ups (slow motion, more lives, lower gravity)
  - Object health - After X number of taps, objects are destroyed


All implemented features were part of our prototype.  
No third party code or libraries were used.
