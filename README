How to use our app: Tap the balls as they fall to send them flying upward -- tapping at different locations will launch them in
                    different direction! Don't let them fall off the bottom of the screen! (For now, if all four balls fall,
                    you will need to restart the app or change the orientation to bring them back.)

Features:           Physics (created from scratch):
                    - Gravity
                    - Vertical and horizontal acceleration caps (to make game more playable)
                    - Collision detection 
                    - Rotational bouncing (by touch and collision)
                    - Wall constraints (ball bounces off left and right sides of screen)

Future features:	- Main menu
						- Level selection
						- Settings
							- Sound (on/off)
							- Customizable physics
					- Game over screen
					- Save high score and display current score during game
					- Different objects with different attributes than balls
					- Power ups (slow motion, more lives, lower gravity)
					- Object health - After X number of taps, objects are destroyed


5.					All implemented features were part of our prototype.
